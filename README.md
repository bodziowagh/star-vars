# Star Vars üöÄ

_A long time ago in a galaxy far far away..._

### What's that? ‚ùì
A simple 3D game created using Three.js

The goal is pretty straightforward, there are asteroids coming your way so the most reasonable thing to do is FIRE YOUR CANONS AND RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! -> Avoid them and shoot to get points. Why would you want to get points? Well, because of reasons.


### Controls ‚å®Ô∏è 
Steer your spacecraft using arrows ‚¨ÖÔ∏è ‚û°Ô∏è and shoot with `spacebar` 

Shooting rockets is only possible when the `cooldown` goes down to `0`, so be careful.
Remember to collect ![#d31515](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) and ![#6ed315](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) blocks - they provide you with rockets and health respectively.

### I wanna play it! How do I do it? üéÆ
To run it, just copy the repo and open the `index.html` file in your browser
